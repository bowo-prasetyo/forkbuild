Core modules must not depend on infrastructure.

Everything is replaceable through interfaces.

The browser is a client, not the owner of the game state.

The ForkBuild Protocol is platform-independent.

Build small, refactor often, keep every milestone runnable.

Prefer composition over inheritance.

Version the protocol independently from the application.

Application orchestrates; Core provides capabilities. Use cases, wiring,
and editor workflows live in application/. Domain data, rules, and the
event machinery that lets Core announce what happened live in core/ —
even when application/ is what constructs and wires that machinery
together (see docs/Architecture.md on why EventBus lives in core/events/
rather than application/events/).
